# My Personal Project - Cat Pixel Maker

## Introduction

My proposed application is a play on the typical avatar makers found online: instead of human
headshots, there are **cats taking the form of old-school, 200x200 pixels**. These are fully 
customizable - in fact, you can customize anything and everything possible, including:
 
- Colours (eyes, fur, markings, etc.) 
- Adding accessories (bows, collars, and even wings)
- Adjusting body proportions (short cat, tall cat, thin cat, fat cat!)
- Giving it one or all mini-animations (bounce, tail flick, blinking...)

This app is aimed at the general public, with a specific emphasis on those who like cats and
avatar makers in general. I have a lot of friends in the artist community that use avatar 
makers, so I know there's a population out there that would appreciate this app. I personally
*love* creating pixel art and programming, so I also thought this would be a good way to 
demonstrate both of my skills (while also showing my love for cats!).
