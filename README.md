# My Personal Project - Cat Pixel Maker

## Introduction

My proposed application is a play on the typical avatar makers found online: instead of human
headshots, there are cats! These are fully customizable - in fact, you can customize:
 
- Colours (eyes, nose, markings, etc.) 
- Adding accessories (hats, bags, and even wings) and backgrounds
- Changing the direction it's facing

This app is aimed at the general public, with a specific emphasis on those who like cats and
avatar makers in general. I have a lot of friends in the artist community that use avatar 
makers, so I know there's a population out there that would appreciate this app. I personally
*love* creating art and programming, so I also thought this would be a good way to 
demonstrate both of my skills (while also showing my love for cats!).

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to name my cat.
- As a user, I want to be able to change the body, colours, and patterns of my cat pixel.
- As a user, I want to be able to add accessories or a background to my cat pixel.
- As a user, I want to be able to make the cat pixel face left or right.
- As a user, I want to be able to save a cat I've made to a cat collection.
- As a user, I want to be able to reload a cat I've made from a cat collection.

## Instructions for Grader

- To generate the first event (a cat), click the "New" button from the initial menu window.
- Second events are generated by modifying the cat: you can add patterns, accessories, and
  backgrounds to the cat. Unrelated, you can change the cat's base, skin, and eye colour 
  as well. These are all done by clicking the respective buttons after hitting "New".
- My entire project is one huge visual component made up of smaller visual components. 
  Everything that doesn't look like it's system-made is all digitally drawn by me.

- You can save a cat you've made by clicking the "New" button from the initial menu window, 
  and then selecting the "Save Cat" button from the next window. You will be prompted to 
  enter a name for your cat so you can distinguish later saved cats from it.
- You can reload a saved cat by selecting the "Load" button from the initial menu window, 
  and clicking on the button of the cat's name you'd like to reload.
